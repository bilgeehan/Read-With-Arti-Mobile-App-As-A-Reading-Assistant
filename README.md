# Read With Arti

Read With Arti is a mobile application for improving speaking and reading skills of users. I developed this mobile application using Java and Firebase. I used NLP and Artificial Intelligence algorithms in my application. The application listens to the user while the user reads the story. Converts the user's speech to string data using Speech-To-Text libraries. Algorithms tokenize the data and compare it to the story. Wrong words are converted to speech using Text-To-Speech libraries
