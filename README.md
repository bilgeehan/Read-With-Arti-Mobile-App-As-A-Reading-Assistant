# Read With Arti

Read With Arti is a mobile application for users to improve their speaking and reading. I developed this mobile application using Java and Firebase. As the user reads the story, the application listens to the user and compares them with the story. Then the user listens to the correct pronunciation of the words and has the opportunity to improve his speech.
