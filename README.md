# Read With Arti

"Read With Arti" is a mobile application developed using Java and Firebase, aiming to enhance users' speaking and reading skills. The app utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms to facilitate its functionalities. Here's a breakdown of its features and technologies:

Features:
1. Speaking and Reading Improvement: The app assists users in improving their speaking and reading abilities through interactive exercises.

2. Speech Recognition: The application listens to users while they read stories or passages aloud.

3. Speech-To-Text Conversion: It employs Speech-To-Text libraries to convert users' spoken words into textual data.

4. Text Tokenization: The app's algorithms tokenize the speech data, breaking it down into individual words or tokens.

5. Text Comparison: The tokenized data is then compared to the original story to assess users' accuracy and proficiency.

6. Error Detection: The app identifies incorrectly pronounced or read words, helping users identify areas for improvement.

7. Text-To-Speech Conversion: To provide immediate feedback, the app converts wrongly pronounced words to speech using Text-To-Speech libraries.

Technologies Used:
1. Java: The primary programming language used for building the Android application.

2. Firebase: Firebase is utilized for various purposes, including real-time database management, user authentication, and cloud-based functionalities.

3. Natural Language Processing (NLP): NLP techniques are implemented to analyze and process natural language input from users.

4. Artificial Intelligence (AI): AI algorithms contribute to the app's ability to evaluate and provide feedback on users' spoken words.

5. Speech-To-Text Libraries: The app integrates Speech-To-Text libraries to convert users' spoken words into text data.

6. Text-To-Speech Libraries: For immediate feedback, the application leverages Text-To-Speech libraries to convert written text into spoken words.

Overall, "Read With Arti" is a comprehensive mobile application that combines the power of NLP, AI, and various libraries to provide an interactive platform for users to improve their speaking and reading skills through engaging exercises and real-time feedback.
